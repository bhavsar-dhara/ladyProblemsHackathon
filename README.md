# TampX Check 
An Android application to suggest the tampon with a correct absorbency level by analysing the survey results of the Tampax algorithm and the emotions recorded using face recognition API of the particular user.

## How it works 
Over 40% of women depend on tampons to give them freedom, confidence and discretion during their periods. Even though over half of these women experience issues like leakage and removal discomfort which could be eliminated by altering tampon absorbency throughout their period, only about 1 out of 10 women varies her tampon absorbency. Our project utilizes input from a woman each time she is changing her tampon - menses flow, length of wear time, activity level, removal discomfort and leakage experienced - to provide a customized recommendation for which tampon absorbency to use next. 

It is not just another period calendar. The app gives a transformational experience that intrigues her to engage and makes it feel essential to continue to managing her period in this way. Our project uses the survey as a base and uses the facial recognition results obtained by capturing the image of a woman in the form of a selfie to enhance the solution.

Being an interactive survey on Android App it is easily accessible as well as fun to fill it up.
